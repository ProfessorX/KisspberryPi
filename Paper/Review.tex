\section{Paper77}
\label{sec:paper77}

This paper should be categorized into theoretical ones. It proclaims a
heuristic optimization algorithm used to speed up the traditional way
of calculating energy consumption. In general, the approach this paper
takes to induce its algorithms is correct but the algorithms are a
little self-evident.
\par
Strengths. The authors created a new algorithm which is both
computationally efficient and more practical than the traditional one.
\par
Weaknesses. The main weakness of this paper is in the
algorithms. There are not some fancy operations but merely patching
the in-use LP method to their own needs, namely, having a tighter
restriction. 
\par
Evaluation. Overall, this paper deserves 7.5/10.
\par
Generally speaking, this pure theoretical paper is well-written with
regard to the specific problem it's tackling. There are no obvious
grammar errors. However, a few citations are missing in the paper in
section 2.1.2 and 2.1.4. It puts forward two algorithms that can be
regarded as a mediocre between MILP and LP. These two algorithms are
created ``in need'', so they are not easy to generalize. Moreover, the
authors do state that this is a much simplified scenario to consider
AC energy consumption optimization so its validity in real-life is
left to be proved.

\section{Paper97}
\label{sec:paper97}

This paper is a theoretical one with real-life data collected and
analyzed by ``best practice'' data mining method, i.e. KNN\@. After
analyzing zone-based occupancy data, one more theoretical HVAC method
is put forward to compete against traditional ON/OFF one. The
simulation of FineTherm method shows a over 30\% energy reduction,
which will be put into examination in real world according to the
authors.
\par
Strengths. A scale-free metric is created to tackle energy efficiency
in office buildings. This metric is generalizable so it's easy for
other researchers to validate. Moreover, the model built to reflect
occupancy is ``preliminary'' at the same time but reported to be
accurate. 
\par
Weaknesses. Overall, the paper is a good one. The main weakness lies
in the STEM equation itself, which is also admitted by authors in
section 2.2. By using this equation we can get a number, but we can
not infer from it the exact situation in the building, the STEM value
is high may due to either a high occupancy or a high energy
consumption. 
\par
In general, this paper demonstrates its contributions properly. We can
find few grammatical errors and sufficient citations to work done
before. From this paper we can get several handy equations to use or
validate. But the occupancy model may suffer in cases like a
completely open office, and as with the FineTherm approach, more
simulations and real world validations are expected.

\section{Paper99}
\label{sec:paper99}

This paper is more or less an experimental one featuring a mobile
phone application used to do sort of ``real-time'' occupant comfort
data collection and a pretty straight-forward algorithm to dynamically
control BMS system, thus improving the overall occupants' comfort
level. 
\par
Strengths. Since this paper focuses more on engineering and
experiments, it is successful with regard to this field. Several
experiments and simulations are carried out to show that the authors'
ideas are applicable. 
\par
Weaknesses. The TCC model described in section 4 is pretty
straight-forward and a little preliminary. Before formally building
their model, the authors make some justifications why they do not use
the other one which may have a higher accuracy. For this part more
comparisons are expected.
\par
In general, this paper does not overstate its contributions. A few
experiments were set based on an algorithm to optimize office
temperature by controlling BMS, with a metric computed using TCC
model. However, the validity of this TCC model is well worth more
investigations. For example, what could the results be if we make the
$L(T_{i},T_{o})$ more complicated?
